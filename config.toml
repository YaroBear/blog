Given the feed filename atom.xml, the generated file will live at base_url/atom.xml, based upon the atom.xml file in the templates directory, or the built-in Atom template.
# feed_filename can be set to any value, but built-in templates are provided for atom.xml (in the preferred Atom 1.0 format), and rss.xml (in the RSS 2.0 format). If you choose a different filename (e.g. feed.xml), you will need to provide a template yourself.
