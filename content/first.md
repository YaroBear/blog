# Welcome

**Hello world** and thanks for stopping by. This blog is dedicated as a self-reference for the things I learn and don't want to forget (and if I do, easy to lookup 🕵️‍♀️).

## A few things to expect from this blog:
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) learnings
* Some C#/Asp.net core, Angular
* Linux
* Vim
* Design patterns
* Cool things I find
* Ramblings

## Also:

There is an [RSS](../../atom.xml) feed!
